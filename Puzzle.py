    Puzzle description:
    You are given a puzzle consisting of a 2D matrix
    consisting of rows of valid movement squares "-" that you can traverse,
    and wall squares "#", that you cannot traverse.
    You can move either up, down, left, or right.
    Also given are a Source cell and Destination cell,
    given as coordinate pairs (a,b) and (x,y).

    The grid is 1-indexed, so the top left corner's coordinate would be (1,1),
    the first row's coordinates would be (1,1), (1,2), (1,3),
    second row would be (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc.

    The object is to move from the Source cell to the Destination cell
    in the fewest steps, not counting the Source or Destination in the final total.

    This function returns the amount of steps between Source and Destination,
    as well as the path taken as a series of directions (Up, Down, Left, Right),
    from the Source to the Destination (the path is for the extra credit portion).

    Example:
    An input of Board = [
    ["-","-","-","-","-"],
    ["-","-","#","-","-"],
    ["-","-","-","-","-"],
    ["#","-","#","#","-"],
    ["-","#","-","-","-"]
    ]

    Makes a grid like this:

    -	-	-	-	-
    -	-	#	-	-
    -	-	-	-	-
    #	-	#	#	-
    -	#	-	-	-

    With a Source of (1,1) and a Destination of (5,5),
    the output would be: 7, RRRRDDDD

    Invalid Destinations will return None.

    if (Source == Destination):
        return "0, Source is the Destination"

    # like we used in the exploration for Dijkstra's algorithm from Week 7.
    # we need to find the valid cells orthogonally adjacent to each cell in the puzzle input,
    # and can give a weight of 1 to each neighboring cell edge to represent a distance of 1 cell.
